# ELM_Stock_Prediction

A project focusing on ELM (Extreme Learning Machine) stock prediction.

The ELM has been regularized in a fashion novel to the literature. This involves using an `L2` regularization plus a residual, inspired by the well-known Theta model, but presented in a more generalized form. This approach also considers the minimization of both RMS (Root Mean Square) correlation and the correlation between the target and prediction. 

The second regularization yields a model that is almost linear, while the third one helps in reducing the oscillations in the prediction.
